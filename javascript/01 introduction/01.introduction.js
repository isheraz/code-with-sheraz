/**
 * JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies 
 * of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages 
 * e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, 
 * etc on different websites -- all of that is built using JavaScript. 
 * Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well 
 * such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop 
 * applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.
